# SP Starter Kit Provisioning Guidance

The following documentation provides guidance related to the the provisioning process of **SP Starter Kit**.

The primary entry point for automatic end-to-end provisioning is the **deploy.ps1** PowerShell script found within the `provisioning` folder.

## Minimal path to success

Open PowerShell and run the following commands, changing the tenant url to your primary SharePoint tenant site. Before running deploy.ps1, use PnP PowerShell to connect to any site in your tenant with the [`Connect-PnPOnline` cmdlet](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/sharepoint-pnp/connect-pnponline?view=sharepoint-ps) using your own tenant url.

```powershell
Connect-PnPOnline https://[yourtenant].sharepoint.com
.\deploy.ps1 -TenantUrl https://[yourtenant].sharepoint.com
```

**Common notes**

- The tenant site you provide is only used to create the initial connection to your tenant. SP Starter Kit will create new demo sites by default. Refer to (SkipSiteCreation parameter)[#-SkipSiteCreation].

- The site hierarchy of the sites created by the deployment process will be read from the hierarchy.json file. **Modify this file as appropriate** The top level site will be provisioned as a **Communication Site** while all children you provide wil be provisioned as **Modern Team Sites**.

- You will be asked for credentials during deployment, those need to be tenant admin credentials. Refer to (Credentials parameter)[#-Credentials].

- If one of the required sites does not exist, the deployment process will create it.

- If the SPFx solution .sppkg file is not present in the **solution** folder tree, the solution will be built and packaged. Force building the solution with the (Build parameter)[#-Build].

- Any existing instances of the SPFx solution in the tenant or site app catalogs will be removed before deployment. Refer to (SkipSolutionDeployment parameter)[#-SkipSolutionDeployment].

## Fixing provisioning errors

- If you run into errors during provisioning, refer to ['Common SP Starter Kit Provisioning results'](../documentation/common-provision-results.md) for additional suggestions and common mistakes

- Refer to the ['Issues List'](https://github.com/SharePoint/sp-starter-kit/issues) to see if anyone else has run into a similar issue, and if so posisble paths to success

- ['Submit a new issue'](https://github.com/SharePoint/sp-starter-kit/issues) if you are unable to find a solution to your specific error or question

## Pre-providing credentials

Credentials may be provided via the command line, or by using the ['Windows credential manager'](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7NJ_qTK1l8).

**Credentials provided via command line**

```powershell
$creds = Get-Credential
Connect-PnPOnline https://[yourtenant].sharepoint.com -Credentials $creds
.\deploy.ps1 -TenantUrl https://[yourtenant].sharepoint.com -Credentials $creds
```
